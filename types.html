        <h1>Types of Graph</h1><br><br>
        <p>There are various types of graphs depending upon the number of vertices, number of edges, interconnectivity, and their
          overall structure. We will discuss only a certain few important types of graphs.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Null Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A <b>graph having no edges</b> is called a Null Graph.</p>
        <br>
        <img src = "./Images/Types of Graphs/Null.png" id = "null">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Trivial Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A graph with only <b>one vertex</b> is called a Trivial Graph.</p>
        <br>
        <img src = "./Images/Types of Graphs/Trivial.png" id = "trivial">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Connected Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A graph G is said to be connected <b>if there exist a path between every pair of vertices</b>.
            There should be at least one edge for every vertex in the graph. So that we can say that it is 
            connected to some other vertex at the other side of the edge.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img src = "./Images/Types of Graphs/Connected.png" id = connected>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Complete Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A simple graph with <b>'n'</b> mutual vertices is called a complete graph and it is <b>denoted by 'Kn'</b>
        In the graph, <b>a vertex should have edges with all other vertices,</b> then it called a complete graph.
        <br>
        <p>In other words, if a vertex is connected to all other vertices in a graph, then it is called a complete graph</p>
         <br>
         <img src = "./Images/Types of Graphs/CompleteGraph.png" id = "complete">       
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Cycle Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A simple graph with <b>'n'</b> vertices <b>(n >= 3)</b> and 'n' edges is called a cycle graph if all its edges form a cycle of length 'n'.</p>   
        <br>
        <img src = "./Images/GraphSample.png" id = "cycle">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Wheel Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A wheel graph is obtained from a cycle graph <b>C<font size = 2>n-1</font></b> </p> by adding a new vertex. That new vertex is called a <b>Hub</b>
        which is connected to all the vertices of C<font size = 2>n</font>.
        <br>

        <img src = "./Images/Types of Graphs/Wheel.png" id = "wheel">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Star Graph</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A star graph is a graph which has single vertex belongs to one set and all the remaining vertices belong to the other set.</p>
        <br>
