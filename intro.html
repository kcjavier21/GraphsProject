        <h2>What is Graph?</h2><br>
        <p>A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. 
        The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as <b>vertices</b>, and the links that connect the vertices are called <b>edges</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Formally, a graph is a pair of sets <b>(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> is the set of vertices and E is the set of <b>edges</b>, connecting the pairs of vertices.</p>

          <b>Electrical Engineering</b> 
          <br>− The concepts of graph theory is used extensively in designing circuit connections. 
          The types or organization of connections are named as topologies. 
          Some examples for topologies are star, bridge, series, and parallel topologies.
